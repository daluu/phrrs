phrrs - PHp Robot Remote Server (can be pronounced "friss" or "furs"?)
=====

PHP generic remote library server for Robot Framework.

This project offers a generic remote server for Robot Framework, implemented in PHP, for use in creating remote libraries. It can alternatively be used for other purposes outside of Robot Framework.

NOTE: this (first-poc) branch is the original proof of concept code implementation of phrrs, archived for easy access to it, should one want it over the new version of phrrs.

This remote server requires the PHP XML-RPC server from http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net. It could probably be modified to use other PHP XML-RPC server modules instead.

See the project wiki on GitHub for more info & details on how to use the server.

For inquiries:

You can post inquiries to Robot Framework Users Google Group as I am a member of that group and periodically check it. If there is enough inquiry activity, I may start a Google Group, etc. for it. You may also file GitHub issues to the project for me to look into as well.
