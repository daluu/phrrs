This directory contains image configuration files for you to build and deploy an environment configuration where you can run phrrs. They are provided as helpful tools in case you have trouble running phrrs in your environment, or don't wish to mess with your environment to test/evaluate phrrs.

There are a few options to pick from for virtual environment deployment. Use at your own risk, these have not been fully tested.

And until there is much desire or need for it, these images won't be deployed to a public repository like Docker Hub, etc. So build the image from these configs if the need arises.
